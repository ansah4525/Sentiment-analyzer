# Sentiment-analyzer
Sentiment analysis is a technique that detects the underlying sentiment in a piece of text. It is the process of classifying text as either positive, negative, or neutral. Machine learning techniques are used to evaluate a piece of text and determine the sentiment behind it . This project uses machine learning and python to analyze texts.. We start off by importing the necessary libraries. Then we go ahead and summarise the article along with creating necessary objects. Some NLP methods are applied and the tone of the text is evaluated.
